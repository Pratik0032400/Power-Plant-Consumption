🔍𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:



𝗪𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱:

➡Track inventory levels, including quantities received (P Quantity), dispatched (D Quantity), and remaining stock (C Quantity).

➡Monitor financial metrics like Gross Amount, D Amount, and Closing Gross Amount to assess inventory value and movement over time.

➡Identify high-demand items (e.g., motors and gloves) that require careful inventory management to prevent shortages or overstocking.



𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱:

➡Measure power generation (Generated Power) against sales and closing stock to ensure optimal energy distribution.

➡Evaluate the costs associated with power generation (T G Cost) and sales (T S Cost) to identify areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvement.

➡Analyse profit rates and trends to optimize profitability and identify periods of higher operational efficiency.



📊𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:

➡The warehouse data shows a well-maintained balance between inventory inflows and outflows, with specific items driving the majority of activity.

➡The power generation data reveals a need for better cost management, as generation costs often exceed sales revenue, affecting overall profitability. ➡Regular monitoring can enhance operational efficiency and financial outcomes.
